 "Analysis of colorectal cancer trends using Microsoft Excel"
Introduction
Colorectal cancer is a major global health concern, contributing to high mortality rates and economic burdens. This analysis explores incidence patterns, survival rates, and the impact of healthcare access using a dataset from Kaggle, analyzed with Microsoft Excel.

Objectives
Identify trends in incidence and mortality rates.
Assess the impact of early vs. late diagnosis.
Examine demographic factors (age, gender, location).
Compare treatment effectiveness.
Analyze the role of healthcare access in survival rates.
Key Findings
Global Disease Burden: 167,497 cases recorded.
Early Detection Rate: 59.9%, highlighting the need for improved screening.
Treatment Outcomes: Surgery (39.9% survival) is most effective, while late-stage treatments show lower success.
Healthcare Access Disparities: Limited access leads to worse survival rates.
Demographics: Higher prevalence in males (60.1%) and highest cases in the USA, China, and South Korea.
Recommendations
Expand screening programs for early detection.
Improve healthcare access in underserved regions.
Increase awareness, especially among high-risk groups.
Prioritize surgical treatments for better survival outcomes.
Develop strategies to manage treatment costs effectively.
Conclusion
Early detection, improved healthcare access, and strategic interventions can significantly enhance colorectal cancer outcomes. This study provides data-driven insights to aid policymakers and medical professionals in combating the disease effectively
